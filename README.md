# idle-dungeon-maker
An idle game, about making dungeons

## Getting Started
This project is built in Rust, using only dependencies that do not require a C++ linker. 

This README assume you're using Windows (on a 64-bit machine) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), use the gnu toolchain to avoid unnecessary yak shaving
- (Optional) Install the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension to improve syntax highlighting and add buttons that reduce the need for terminal commands

Use `cargo build` in your terminal at the project root to build the project and `cargo run` to run it
